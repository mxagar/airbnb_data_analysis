# Planning Your Next Vacation in Spain

Subtitle: A data-based approach using AirBnB's dataset from the Basque Country

In 2020 I decided to move back to my birthplace in the Basque Country (Spain) after almost 15 years in Munich (Germany). The Basque region in Spain is a popular touristic destination, as it has a beautiful seaside with a plethora of surfing bays and alluring hills that call for hiking and climbing adventures. Culture and gastronomy are also important features, embedded in a friendly and developed society with modern infrastructure.

When the pandemic seemed to start fading away in spring 2022, friends and acquaintances from Europe began asking me about the best spots and trips in the region, hotels and hostals to stay in case there was no room in my place, etc. The truth is, after so many years abroad I was not the best person to guide them with the best information; however, the AirBnB dataset from Euskadi (i.e., Basque Country in Basque), has clarified some of my questions.
