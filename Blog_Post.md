In 2020 I decided to move back to my birthplace in the [Basque Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(autonomous_community)) (Spain) after almost 15 years in Munich (Germany). The Basque region in Spain is a popular touristic destination, as it has a beautiful seaside with a plethora of surf bays and alluring hills that call for hiking and climbing adventures. Culture and gastronomy are also important features, both embedded in a friendly and developed society with modern infrastructure.

When the pandemic seemed to start fading away in spring 2022, friends and acquaintances from Europe began asking me about the best spots and trips in the region, hotels and hostels to stay in case there was no room in my place, etc. The truth is, after so many years abroad I was not the best person to guide them with updated information; however, the [AirBnB dataset from *Euskadi*](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) (i.e., Basque Country in [Basque language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language)) has clarified some of my questions. The dataset contains, among others, a list of 5228 accomodations, each one of them with 74 variables.

Following the standard [CRISP-DM process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) for data analysis, I have cleaned, processed and modelled the dataset to answer three major business questions:

1. **Prices**. Is it possible to build a model that predicts the price given the variables? If so, which are the most important variables that determine the price? Can we detect accommodations that, having a good review score, are a bargain?
2. **Differences between accomodations with and without beach access**. Surfing or simply enjoying the seaside are probably some important attractions visitors seek on their vacations. However, not all accommodations are a walk distance from a beach. How does that influence the features of the housings?
3. **Differences between the two most important cities: [Donostia-San Sebastian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Sebasti√°n) and [Bilbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao)**. These province capitals are the biggest and most visited cities in the Basque Country; in fact, their listings account for 50% of all offered accommodations. However, both cities are said to have a different character: Bilbao is a bigger, modern city, without beach access but probably with a richer cultural offerings and nightlife; meanwhile, Donostia-San Sebastian is aesthetic, it has three beaches and it's perfect for day-strolling. How are those popular differences reflected on the features of the accommodations?

In the following, I provide a brief explanatory section on the data processing I carried out. The remainder of the blog post focuses on the three questions introduced above.

## The Dataset and Its Processing

If you'd like go directly to the meat, you can skip this section. Here, I give an overview of most what is done in all the four notebooks of my [Gihub repository](https://github.com/mxagar/airbnb_data_analysis) that help answer the questions pose above. Those preliminary steps consist of the data cleaning, the feature engineering and selection and the data modelling.

AirBnB provides with several CSV files for each world region: (1) a listing of properties that offer accommodation, (2) reviews related to the listings, (3) a calendar and (4) geographical data. A detailed description of the features in each file can be found in the official [dataset dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896).

My analysis has concentrated on the listings file, which consists in a table of 5228 rows/entries (i.e., the accommodation places) and 74 columns/features (their attributes). Among the features, we find **continuous variables**, such as:

- price of the complete accommodation,
- accommodates: maximum number of persons that can be accommodated,
- review scores for different dimensions,
- reviews per month,
- longitude and latitude,
- etc.

... **categorical variables**:

- neighbourhood name,
- property type (apartment, room, hotel, etc.)
- licenses owned by the host,
- amenities offered in the accommodation, 
- etc.

... **date-related data**:

- first and last review dates, 
- date when the host joined the platform,

... and **image and text data**:

- URL of the listing,
- URL of the pictures,
- description if the listing,
- etc.

Of course, not all features are meaningful to answer the posed questions. Additionally, a preliminary exploratory data analysis shows some peculiarities of the dataset. For instance, in contrast to city datasets like [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) or [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston), the listings from the Basque country are related to a complete state in Spain; hence, the neighbourhoods recorded in them are, in fact, cities or villages spread across a large region. Moreover, the price distribution shows several outliers. Along these lines, I have performed the following simplifications:

- Only the 60 (out of 196) neighbourhoods (i.e., cities and villages) with the most listings have been taken; these account for almost 90% of all listings. That reduction has allowed to manually encode neighbourhood properties, such as whether a village has access to a beach in less than 2 km (Question 2).
- Only the listings with a price below 1000 USD have been considered.
- The features that are irrelevant for modelling and inference have been dropped (e.g., URLs and scrapping information).
- From fields that contain medium length texts (e.g., description), only the language has been identified with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-langdetect). The rest of the text fields have been encoded as categorical features.

One of my first actions with the price was to divide it by the number of maximum accommodates to make it unitary, i.e., USD per person. However, the models underperform. Additionally, both variables don't need to have a linear relationship: maybe the accommodates value considers the places in the sofa bed, and the price does not increase if they are used, or not relative to the base unitary price.

As far as the **data cleaning** is considered, only entries that have price (target for Question 1) and review values have been taken. In case of more than 30% of missing values in a feature, that feature has been dropped. In other cases, the missing values have been filled (i.e., imputed) with either the median or the mode.

Additionally, I have applied **feature engineering** methods to almost all variables:

- Any numerical variable with a skewed distribution has been either transformed using logarithmic or power mappings, or binarized.
- Categorical columns have been [one-hot encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot).
- All features have been scaled to the region `[0,1]`.

The dataset that results after the feature engineering consists of 3931 entries and 354 features. We have almost 5 times more features than in the beginning even with dropped variables because each class in the categorical variables becomes a feature; in particular, there are many amenities, property types and neighbourhoods.

Finally, in order to prevent overfitting and make the interpretation easier, I have carried a [lasso regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) to perform **feature selection**. Lasso regression is a L1 regularized regression which forces the model coefficients to converge to 0 if they have small values; subsequently, the features with small coefficient values can be dropped. That reduces the number of variables from 354 to 122. Thus, the final dataset has 3931 entries and 122 features.

## Question 1: Prices

I have trained two models with 90% of the processed dataset using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): (1) a [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) (L2 regularized regression) model and (2) a [random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) model. The latter seems to score the best R2 value: 69% of the variance can be explained with the random decision trees. The following diagram shows the model performance for the test split.

<p align="center">

</p>

The models tend to underpredict accommodation prices; that bias clearly increases as the prices start to be larger than 50 USD. Such a moderate R2 is not the best one to apply the model to perform predictions. However, we can deduce the most important features that determine the listing prices if we compute the [Gini importances](https://medium.com/the-artificial-impostor/feature-importance-measures-for-tree-models-part-i-47f187c1a2c3), as done in the following diagram. The top-5 variables that determine the price of a listing are:

- whether an accommodation is an entire home or appartment,
- the number of bathrooms in it,
- the number of accommodates,
- whether the bathroom(s) is/are shared,
- and whether the housing is located in Donostia-San Sebastian.

<p align="center">
<img src="/pics/regression_feature_importance_rf.png" alt="Feature importance: Gini importance values of the random forests model" width="600"/>
</p>

Note that only the top-30 features are shown; these account to 90% of the accummulated Gini importance (all 122 variables would account for 100%).

But how does increasing the value of each feature affect the price: does it contribute to an increase in price or a decrease? That can be observed in the following diagram, equivalent to the previous one. In contrast to the former, here the 30 regression coefficients with the largest magnitude are plotted -- red bars are associated with features that decrease the price when they are increased.

</p>

Being different models, different features appear in the ranking; in any case, both sets are consistent and provide valuable insights. For instance, we deduce that the price decreases the most when 

- the accommodation is a shared room,
- the number of reviews per month increases (note that review positivity is not measured),
- the accommodation is a hostel room,
- the host is estimated to have shared rooms,
- and when the bathroom(s) is/are shared.

Finally, a very practical the accommodations which have a very good average review (above the 90% percentile) and have a model price larger than the real one

I will not post the URLs of the detected listings, but you can find them quite easily using the notebooks of the linked repository :wink:.

## Question 2: To Beach or not to Beach

Of course, you can always go to the beach to catch some waves in the Basque Country, but doing it on foot in less than 15 minutes has an additional cost on average. That is one of the insights distilled from the next diagram.

This difference or significance plot shows the [T and Z statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) computed for each feature considering two independent groups: accommodations with and without beach access. These statistics are related to the difference of means (T statistic, for continuous variables) or proportions (Z statistic, for discrete variables or proportions). If we take the usual significance level of 5%, the critical Z or T value is roughly 2. That means that if the values in the diagram are greater than 2, the averages or proportions of each group in each feature are significantly different. The probability of being otherwise but incorrectly stating that they are different is 5%.

The sign of the statistic is color-coded: blue bars denote positive statistics, which are associated with larger values for accommodations that have beach access.

<p align="center">
<img src="/pics/beach_comparison.png" alt="Feature differences between accomodations with and without beach access" width="600"/>
</p>

Long story short, here's the intepretation: the group of accommodations that have a beach within 2 km have significantly larger

- proportions of accomodations located in the provvince of Gipuzkoa,
- proportions of accomodations with a waterfront,
- and prices.

We can continue with the list until the significant differences disappear down in the ranking with the amenity *dishes and silverware*. **Note that larger statistics don't necessarily mean larger differences; instead, they mean that the probability of wrongly stating a difference between groups is lower.**

However, it is more interesting to compose a *profile* of listings with beach access and without selecting features manually; for instance, accomodations on the seaside:

- have larger prices,
- are more often entire homes or appartments,
- usually have less shared bathrooms,
- have more often a description in English,
- have more often patios of balconies,
- have more bedrooms,
- allow for more accommodates,
- their host lives more often nearby,
- ...

Going back to the price, the following figure shows the different price distributions for accommodations with a beach in less than 2km and further. We need to consider that there such a distribution or a congtingency table behind each of the Z/T statistics in the previous diagram.

## Question 3: Athletic de Bilbao vs. Real Sociedad

If you're a soccer fan, maybe you've heard about the Basque derby: [Athletic de Bilbao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao) vs. [Real Sociedad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad). Both football teams are originally from the two major cities, Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastian, and they represent the healthy rivalry between the two province capitals. 

In order to determine the differences between the two cities in terms of listing features, I have computed the same difference or significance plot as before, shown below.

<p align="center">
<img src="/pics/donostia_bilbao_comparison.png" alt="Feature differences between accomodations in Donostian-San Sebastian and Bilbao" width="600"/>
</p>

Donostia-San Sebastian seems to have

- larger prices,
- more descriptions in English,
- more often patios of balconies,
- more often entire homes or appartments,
- more space for accommodates,
- ...

On the other hand, Bilbao has

- more shared bedrooms,
- more amenities such as hangers, first aid kits, extra pillows, breakfast
- ...

Finally, as before, I leave the price distribution for both cities, since it is the feature in which the difference is more significant. We can see that the distribution from Bilbao has more units in the lowest price region, whereas the red city lacks listings with prices above 150 USD, compared to Donostia-San Sebastian. That is in line with several already explained facts, such as that Bilbao has more shared rooms whereas Donostia has more entire homes, while being the effect on the price of both characteristics the opposite.

## Conclusions

In this blog post, we took a look at the AirBnB accommodation properties for the Basque Country, narrowing down to these insights:

1. A
2. B
3. C

These conclusions are quite informal, but I hope they can guide my data-savvy friends; in any case, I'm sure you can have a great vacation anywhere you go in the Basque Country :)
